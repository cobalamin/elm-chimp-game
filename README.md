# Chimp Game: Elm edition

This is an Elm implementation of a memory game that chimpanzees vastly outperform humans at, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0 :)

There are two versions:
	- `hide-after-delay` hides the numbers after a fixed amount of time, adjustable with a slider. Young chimps can go down to 500ms here. Interactive editor at https://ellie-app.com/5S8TfP7TpBna1
	- `hide-after-first-click` hides the numbers only after the first click on a number. Interactive editor at https://ellie-app.com/5S8T5xw6vpka1

This Elm code was quickly hacked together and can certainly be improved in a number of ways. Use it for inspiration, not for reference :D
