# Chimp Game: Elm edition

This is an Elm implementation of a memory game that chimpanzees vastly outperform humans at, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0 :)

There are two versions, linked are [Ellie](https://ellie-app.com) sessions where you can try them out and edit the code:

- [`hide-after-delay`](https://ellie-app.com/5S8TfP7TpBna1) hides the numbers after a fixed amount of time, adjustable with a slider. Young chimps can go down to 500ms here.
- [`hide-after-first-click`](https://ellie-app.com/5S8T5xw6vpka1) hides the numbers only after the first click on a number.

This Elm code was quickly hacked together and can certainly be improved in a number of ways. Use it for inspiration, not for reference :D
